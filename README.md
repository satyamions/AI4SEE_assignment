# YOLO Object Detection and Google Drive Upload

This project uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection from video files. Detected objects are cropped from the video frames, saved as images, and uploaded to Google Drive.

## Features

- **YOLO Object Detection**: Detects and crops objects from video frames.
- **Google Drive Upload**: Uploads cropped object images to Google Drive.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PyDrive

You can install the necessary Python packages using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy pydrive
```

## YOLO Files

Due to size constraints, the YOLO weight files and configuration files are not included in this repository. You can download them from the following links:

- [YOLOv3 Weights](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)
- [YOLOv3 Configuration File](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg)
- [COCO Names File](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names)

## Setup

1. **Download YOLO Files**: Download the YOLO weights, configuration file, and class names file from the links above.
2. **Place Files in Directory**: Ensure the downloaded files (`yolov3.weights`, `yolov3.cfg`, `coco.names`) are in the same directory as the script.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Video File**: Place the video file you want to process in the same directory as the script.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Check Output**: The cropped object images will be saved in the `output_objects` folder.


## Notes

- Make sure you have valid credentials and the required permissions to upload files to Google Drive.
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection during the upload process.
